# Big-O-Calculations

Final project in Data Structures, Spring 2017. Accomplished with the help of project mate, Timothy Rollings.

The code is very heavily documented, a byproduct of more naive coding days, but the work is still there!

Purpose
-------
This program demonstrates demonstrates the Big-O Notations of 5 sorting algorithms and a Binary Tree.
Tests were run on data of sizes 50, 5000, and 100000.
